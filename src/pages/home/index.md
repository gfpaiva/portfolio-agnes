      By expanding their creative toolset to include new and innovative effects,
      YouTube expanded their platform for creators which increased engagement
      for viewers, and solidified YouTube as a daily destination. My role was to
      create effects, filters, and stickers for the YouTube Reels as part of the
      design team.
